The Notes Maker project is approached with a structured methodology, dividing responsibilities into stateful backend controllers and stateless frontend components.
On the backend, Express.js connects to MongoDB Atlas, with server.js acting as the controller for CRUD operations.
The frontend uses React.js, where App.js manages overall state and communication with the backend, while stateless components like AddNote.js and NoteList.js handle UI elements.
A minimal directory structure ensures clarity, and CSS styling enhances the user interface.
